## Motivation and Objectives:
Over 105 million dengue infections are estimated to occur annually. 
Understanding the disease dynamics of dengue is often difficult due to multiple strains circulating within a population. 
Interactions between dengue serotypes dynamics may result in complex cross-immunity dynamics at the population level and create difficulties in terms of 
formulating intervention strategies for the  disease. In this study, a nationally representative 16-year time series with over 43,000 
serotyped dengue infections was used to infer the long-run effects of between and within strain interactions and their impacts on past outbreaks. 
We used a novel identification strategy incorporating sign-identified Bayesian vector autoregressions, 
using structural impulse responses, historical decompositions and counterfactual analysis to conduct inference on dengue dynamics post-estimation. 
We found that on the population level: (1) across-serotype interactions on the population level were highly persistent, 
with a one time increase in any other serotype associated to long run decreases in the serotype of interest (Range: 0.5 -- 2.5 years) 
(2) Over 38.7% of dengue cases of any serotype were associated to across-serotype interactions.
The findings in this paper will substantially impact public health policy interventions with respect to dengue.
